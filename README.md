### Why did you make yet another pipe mod?
* We believe a lot of people are interested in a Thermal Dynamics-like pipe mod.
* I (Technici4n) have written instantaneous pipes for Modern Industrialization, and I want to try doing non-instantaneous pipes now.
It's a lot more complex, which makes it fun.

### Why are you copying Thermal Dynamics?
* Reusing TD's concepts allows us to focus on getting the core logic working for now,
but once the mod is working we will revisit some design decisions to further improve the mod.
* Reusing TD's textures (modified) is allowed by TD's license. All code is original.
